## **What is the 'The Burnt City' ?**

The Burnt City is an interactive theatre experience by a theatre company called Punchdrunk. They specialise in immersive experiences. Usually involving theatre sets that span multiple buildings/floors/rooms so, finding your way around these spaces can be an interesting exercise.

## **Isn't this spoiling the experience for people ?**

If you haven't already seen TBC, I'd advise you to go in cold. Avoid spoilers. Throw yourself into the pool and see if you can swim. Once you've done that, have a look at a map, refresh your memory about places you've seen. Find the places you didn't see the first time around and make plans for your next visit.

## **OK, so what is this ?**

This is a 'slippy' map implimentation of Eleanor Odell's Burnt City map, crossed with more recent data from the "Architect's Dream" map. 

You can scroll, zoom, add map layers, tap map markers to get more detail. 

For accessibility there's a certain zoom layer which, when activated, will increase the font size up more than a few notches.

The map markers are actually read in from a Google sheet which means a couple of things.

1. You can share edit rights of those sheets with other people to crowd source better data
2. You can just add another Google Sheet and make another layer super easily.

## **Is there an example I can look at ?**

You can look at my version on my website [here](https://d834256.radium-basement.com/tbc/).

## **Can I not just use your map? Why do I need this ?**

You might want to add your own map layers, or crowdsource your own map points of interest with friends or your own community. Or you might want to use the code included here for something else completely. Entirely up to you.

## **Is everything provided here that I need ?**

No, there are some 3rd party tools that you'll need to download yourself. Hopefully my instructions will be enough to get you up and running.
